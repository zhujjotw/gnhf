# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents1 when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`animo` is a CLI that runs a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Rovo Dev, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, Pi, or an ACP target) in a loop inside a git repo. Each successful iteration is a separate commit, normally on a dedicated `animo/<slug>` branch; `--current-branch` uses the existing branch instead, and `--push` publishes each successful iteration. Failures get `git reset --hard` except commit failures, which preserve uncommitted work for repair; retryable hard agent errors trigger exponential backoff, and permanent agent errors abort immediately. Target: Node 20+, published to npm as a bundled ESM CLI with optional agent-facing skills under `skills/`.

## Commands

```sh
npm run build          # tsdown bundle → dist/cli.mjs (the published binary)
npm run dev            # tsdown --watch
npm run lint           # ESLint on src
npm run format         # Prettier on src (format:check for CI)
npm run typecheck      # tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json --noEmit
npm test               # build, then vitest run (all tests)
npm run test:e2e       # build, then vitest run e2e/
npm run test:coverage  # vitest with coverage, excludes e2e/
```

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run src/core/orchestrator.test.ts`. Filter by name: `npx vitest run -t "name substring"`. Unit tests live next to source as `*.test.ts`; e2e tests live under `e2e/` and shell out to the built `dist/cli.mjs` against a mock `opencode` server in `e2e/fixtures/`, so they require a prior build (`npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` do this automatically). Add new e2e tests as `e2e/*.test.ts` so they're picked up by the directory glob in both scripts.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, format:check, typecheck, and test on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows with Node 24 - keep all four green. Releases are automated via release-please; never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json`.

## Architecture

Entry point is `src/cli.ts`. It parses flags with commander, resolves config, handles stdin/worktree/resume setup, then hands off to the orchestrator. Everything else is plain modules under `src/`.

### Run lifecycle (the critical flow)

1. `cli.ts` decides one of four modes: new branch, resume an existing `animo/<slug>` branch, `--current-branch`, or `--worktree` (creates a sibling `<repo>-animo-worktrees/<slug>/` checkout). New branch and worktree runs probe numeric suffixes such as `animo/<slug>-1` and `<repo>-animo-worktrees/<slug>-1/` on collisions; current-branch runs first resume an exact same-prompt `.animo/runs/<runId>/` on a clean working tree, otherwise they probe `.animo/runs/<runId>-1/` metadata collisions without creating a branch; worktree mode also resumes preserved suffixed worktrees before creating a new one. When resuming with a different prompt, it asks whether to update `prompt.md` and continue the existing run history, start a new branch, or quit; if stdin is piped, that confirmation comes from the controlling terminal before any sleep-prevention re-exec. `setupRun`/`resumeRun` in `src/core/run.ts` create `.animo/runs/<runId>/` with `prompt.md`, `notes.md`, `output-schema.json`, `base-commit`, optional `stop-when`, `commit-message`, and `animo.log`, and add `.animo/runs/` to `.git/info/exclude` so run metadata stays local.
2. `Orchestrator` (`src/core/orchestrator.ts`) is an `EventEmitter` loop. Each iteration: build prompt via `src/templates/iteration-prompt.ts` (injects current `notes.md`), add commit-repair instructions when a prior `git commit` failed, call `agent.run(...)`, then on success `commitAll` + append to `notes.md` and optionally `pushCurrentBranch`; on failure `resetHard` unless a pending commit failure is preserving uncommitted work for repair. `commitAll` throws `CommitFailedError` on commit failure, logs `git:commit:failed`, and records the commit output in `notes.md` so the next iteration can repair the workspace. Push failures abort after preserving the successful local commit. Agent-reported failures continue immediately, retryable thrown agent errors increment the backoff streak, and `PermanentAgentError` aborts immediately after rollback with `lastAgentError` set for the renderer unless a pending commit failure is preserving work. Three consecutive failures abort. The `RunLimits` object enforces `--max-iterations` (between iterations), `--max-tokens` (mid-iteration via AbortController), `--stop-when` (post-iteration, honored on both successful and failed iterations when the agent sets `should_fully_stop` in its output, except after commit failures until repair work is committed), and `--push` post-success publishing.
3. `Renderer` (`src/renderer.ts` + `src/renderer-diff.ts`) is a cell-based TUI using the alt screen buffer. `cli.ts` enters/exits alt screen around it. The renderer subscribes to orchestrator events, diffs frames to minimize writes, and updates the terminal title live. `MockOrchestrator` (`src/mock-orchestrator.ts`) drives the renderer offline via `--mock` for demos/testing.
4. Shutdown path: `SIGINT` routes through `orchestrator.handleInterrupt()`. The first press requests a graceful stop, letting the current iteration finish or ending backoff early; the second press force-stops via `orchestrator.stop()`. `SIGTERM` force-stops immediately. `cli.ts` only keeps the done screen open for aborted runs; graceful stops exit once shutdown cleanup finishes. If it's a `--worktree` run with zero commits and no pending commit failure, the worktree is removed; otherwise it's preserved and the path is printed. After cleanup, `cli.ts` collects final branch/diff stats via `src/core/git.ts` and writes the permanent stdout summary rendered by `src/core/exit-summary.ts`, including an uncommitted-work warning when a commit failure is still pending.

### Agents (`src/core/agents/`)

Each agent implements the `Agent` interface in `types.ts` (`name`, async `run(prompt, cwd, options)` returning `{ output, usage }`, optional `close()`). They share two responsibilities: stream stdout, extract a structured `AgentOutput` (`success`, `summary`, `key_changes_made`, `key_learnings`, commit-message fields when configured, plus `should_fully_stop` only when `--stop-when` is active) that matches the schema built by `buildAgentOutputSchema(...)`, and accumulate `TokenUsage`. `factory.ts` picks one based on config.

- `claude.ts` / `codex.ts` / `copilot.ts` / `pi.ts`: spawn the CLI per iteration in non-interactive mode. Codex uses `--output-schema` pointing at the run's schema file; Claude uses `--json-schema`, treats the last successful structured result as terminal, raises `PermanentAgentError` for low credit balance exits, and after a short grace period shuts down a lingering Claude process tree if it stays alive. Copilot uses JSONL output plus prompt-level schema instructions, then parses the final `assistant.message` content. Pi runs in JSON mode, appends the final output schema to the prompt, and parses the assistant JSON reply from Pi's streamed events.
- `rovodev.ts` / `opencode.ts`: long-running local HTTP servers managed via `managed-process.ts` (start once, reuse across iterations, close on shutdown). OpenCode creates a per-run session and applies a blanket allow rule to avoid prompt blocking.
- `acp.ts`: handles `acp:<target-or-command>` specs through the bundled `acpx` runtime and registry. It keeps a persistent per-run session keyed by run ID under `.animo/runs/<runId>/acp-sessions`, embeds the output schema in the prompt, parses only output text deltas as final JSON, records ACP lifecycle events in `animo.log`, and reports per-iteration token usage from ACP `used` deltas when available with prompt-length plus tool-call estimates as a fallback. Estimated ACP usage is marked for the renderer so totals are prefixed with `~`. Path and arg overrides are native-agent-only; ACP targets are customized via `acpRegistryOverrides` in config (a target-name -> spawn-command map fed into acpx's agent registry) or by passing a raw ACP server command directly after `acp:`. Raw command specs are redacted to `acp:custom`/`custom` in debug logs, errors, and telemetry. The e2e suite exercises the full wire path against the `acp-mock` package registered through that same override mechanism.
- `json-extract.ts`: shared recovery for final agent JSON that may be fenced or prose-wrapped; use it before adding ad-hoc parsing to integrations that must validate output against the agent schema.
- `stream-utils.ts`: shared JSONL parsing, `AbortSignal` wiring, and child-process lifecycle helpers. When touching agent streaming, start here.

Reserved args managed by animo are rejected in `config.ts` via `isReservedAgentArg` - if you add a new flag that animo controls, add it to that list so user overrides can't shadow it.

### Config (`src/core/config.ts`)

Loads `~/.animo/config.yml` (bootstrapped on first run). CLI flags override config; runtime-only flags (`--max-iterations`, `--max-tokens`, `--stop-when`) are never persisted to config. `--stop-when` is persisted per run for resume. `agent` accepts native agent names plus `acp:<target-or-command>` specs; `agentPathOverride` and `agentArgsOverride` are native-agent-only, and paths resolve relative to `~/.animo/` with `~` expansion. `acpRegistryOverrides` maps ACP target names to spawn commands, threaded into acpx's agent registry so `acp:<name>` resolves against the override map first - useful for pinning a custom or local build of an ACP agent while keeping logs/telemetry on the named target. Raw ACP command specs can also be passed directly and are logged as `acp:custom`. `commitMessage.preset: conventional` adds commit-message fields to the output schema/prompt and changes successful-iteration commit subjects; the resolved convention is persisted per run so resume does not silently switch formats after config changes.

### Git helpers (`src/core/git.ts`)

All git invocations go through `execFileSync` with explicit argv. `git.injection.test.ts` guards against shell-metachar leakage via branch names and prompts - add a case there whenever you accept new user input that flows into git args.

### Sleep prevention (`src/core/sleep.ts`)

When `preventSleep` is on and the process wasn't already re-exec'd under a sleep-inhibitor, animo re-execs itself under `caffeinate` (macOS), `systemd-inhibit` (Linux), or a PowerShell `SetThreadExecutionState` helper (Windows). The re-exec uses `ANIMO_SLEEP_INHIBITED=1` as the loop-breaker and `ANIMO_REEXEC_STDIN_PROMPT_FILE` to pass piped stdin across the re-exec (the original process writes a 0600 temp file, the child reads and unlinks it).

### Telemetry (`src/core/telemetry.ts`)

Anonymous run summaries POSTed to a self-hosted Umami instance.
One pageview at run start and one `track("run", ...)` event at the end - never per-iteration, and never with `cwd`, branch slug, prompt content, or anything else that could identify a user or repo.
Build-time defaults are injected via `tsdown.config.ts`'s `define` from `ANIMO_UMAMI_HOST` / `ANIMO_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`; runtime env vars of the same name override, and `ANIMO_TELEMETRY=0|false|off` disables.
**User-facing docs about telemetry must stay minimal: cover only the opt-out env var (`ANIMO_TELEMETRY=0`) and that the data is anonymous. Do not document fields, endpoint, or build-time injection in the README.**

## Conventions

- ESM-only, `.js` import extensions in TypeScript source (`import { foo } from "./foo.js"`). tsdown bundles it all into `dist/cli.mjs`.
- Unit tests co-located as `*.test.ts`; e2e tests under `e2e/`. Prefer e2e (new or existing) for behavior that crosses a process/IO boundary - CLI flags, config loading, git, agent spawning, stdout - since these match how the product is actually used and have proven less brittle than mock-heavy unit tests in this codebase. Unit-test pure helpers (schema builders, prompt templates, formatters) where speed and failure localization are worth more than realism. Use TDD for bugfixes and new features.
- Error paths matter - `debug-log.ts` writes JSONL lifecycle events to `.animo/runs/<id>/animo.log` with full `error.cause` chains. Prefer `appendDebugLog("category:event", {...})` over ad-hoc logging.
- No em dashes ("-"). No auto-added Claude co-author lines in commits.
